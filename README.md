 # My Very First Web Page
 
 ## Purpose of the Project
 This is my first project beginning with my
 introduction to HTML and ending with pushing
 my code to Git Hub
 
 ### Why I Am So Happy About the Results
 I almost threw in the towel because I 
 thought I need to get everything right
 the first time but I learned from others
 that is the hardest section.
 
 ### Using the Tools Given to Me
 
 I feel that by learning to reach out
 to my mentors, tutors and others on this
 project I have learned that not everything
 comes overnight but there is always support
 out there willing to help me over the many
 hurdles along the way and with that 
 trust I can become part of a team that is
 learning this all together.
 
### What I don't like

The screen for the sample coding is way
too small for me to see, even when wearing
my glasses. This makes it difficult to 
follow along. I hope to find a way to make
the video larger in the tutorial screen.

## Yay! This part is finished.
